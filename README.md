sql home work repository 1-18-21
Per the instructions created a publicly accessable repository named EmployeeSQL
Used the quickdatabaseddiagrams.com link to provide an ERD for the homework assignment
once ERD was created, exported as a .png and .sql file.
used resulting .sql file to layout the tables in the database
learned that doing so resulted in table names that required case-sensitive names.
modified that error causing issue to a normal convention.
imported .csv files from the resources folder into the tables to fill the newly created database.
used the instructions to develope the queries per the assignment.
used w3schools, gitlab bootcamp spot and postgreSQL resources to configure the queries.
created a "complete" .sql file to push to the main only to realize the database creation and queries needed to be separate .sql files.
pushed everything to the main for submission.
